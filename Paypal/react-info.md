NEXT.JS - returns all data as SPA from server side -> SSR -> pre-rendering -> faster than CSR

Next.js is a backend framework which is based on React.
Everything we can do in React we can also do in Next.js – with some additional features like routing, API calls, authentication, and more. We don’t have these features in React. Instead, we have to install some external libraries and dependencies – like React Router for routing in a single page React app, for example.
But in Next.js, things are different. We don’t have to rely on external libraries to get these kinds of things done. They come built into the package when we create a Next.js app.


Next.js also uses something called server-side rendering.

It send all the contact as SPA from server side -> SSR - SERVER SIDE RENDERING


React - CSR - CLIENT SIDE RENDERING  
Whenever we load a React application, all the UI components get generated on the browser, dynamically. It just send main root tag , thereby on browser it dynamically renders components.
